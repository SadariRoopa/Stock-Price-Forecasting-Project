📊 STOCK_FORECASTING
Stock Price Forecasting Project

This repository contains code, data handling, and results for predicting future stock prices using machine learning time series methods like LSTM and ARIMA.

🧠 Overview
This project aims to forecast stock prices using deep learning (LSTM) and/or statistical models (ARIMA). It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization to provide an end-to-end time series forecasting pipeline for financial data.

🚀 Features
📥 Data collection & preprocessing

🧮 Time series feature engineering

🔮 Forecasting using LSTM/ARIMA

📈 Visualization of predictions vs. actual prices

🧩 Modular and extensible codebase
